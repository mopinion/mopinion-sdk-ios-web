# Mopinion Mobile web SDK iOS

The Mopinion Mobile SDK can be used to collect feedback from iOS apps based on events.
To use Mopinion mobile web feedback forms in your app you can include the SDK as a Framework in your Xcode project.

Other Mopinion SDK's are also available:

- [iOS SDK](https://github.com/Mopinion-com/mopinion-sdk-ios)
- [Android SDK](https://github.com/Mopinion-com/mopinion-sdk-android)
- [Android web SDK](https://github.com/mopinion/mopinion-sdk-android-web)

## Release notes for version 0.6.0
### Changes in 0.6.0
- Built with Xcode 14.3, tested on iOS 16.
- Minimum iOS version raised to 11.
- Calls to the evaluate(), event(), load() and openFormAlways() methods now execute in serial order.
- Introduces new state `NO_FORM_WILL_OPEN` for callbacks.

### Remarks
- This readme is also included in github release 0.6.0-swiftpm, which is repackaged for Swift Package Manager. That release is not designed for cocoapods.
- For cocoapods, only use the plain 0.6.0 release. 

<br>

## <a name="install">Install</a>

The Mopinion Mobile SDK Framework can be installed via either the Swift Package Manager or the popular dependency manager [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org).

### Install via Swift Package Manager in Xcode 14
1. If you no longer want to use CocoaPods for your project, then in terminal, at the root folder of your project execute: <br>
`pod deintegrate`

2. Open your project's `<your-project-name>.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3. In Xcode 14, from the menu, select `File -> Add Packages…`.  
The Swift Package Collections panel appears. 
4. In the search field of the panel, enter `https://github.com/mopinion/mopinion-sdk-ios-web` and press enter.
5. From the drop-down button `Dependency Rule` , choose `Exact Version` and in the version field enter `0.6.0-swiftpm`.
6. Click the button `Add Package`. A package product selection panel appears.
7. Choose `MopinionSDK` and click the button `Add Package`. 

<br>

### Install CocoaPods native on ARM based Macs

From macOS Monterey 12.1 installation of cocoapods 1.11.2 works out of the box:

```sh
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Install the SDK with CocoaPods

For Xcode 14, make a `Podfile` in root of your project:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!
target '<YOUR TARGET>' do
	pod 'MopinionSDKWeb', '>= 0.6.0'
end
```

Install the needed pods:

`$ pod install`

After this you should use the newly made `<your-project-name>.xcworkspace` file to open in Xcode.

<br>

## <a name="implement">Implement the SDK</a>

In your app code, for instance the `AppDelegate.swift` file, put:

```swift
import MopinionSDK
...
// debug mode
MopinionSDK.load(<MOPINION DEPLOYMENT KEY>, true)
// live
MopinionSDK.load(<MOPINION DEPLOYMENT KEY>)
```

The `<MOPINION DEPLOYMENT KEY>` should be replaced with your specific deployment key. Copy this key using a web browser from your Mopinion account, in side menu `Data collection`, section `Deployments`, via the button with symbol `<>`.

In a UIViewController, for example `ViewController.swift`, put:

```swift
import MopinionSDK
...
MopinionSDK.event(self, "_button")
```
where `"_button"` is the default passive form event.
You can also make custom events and use them in the Mopinion deployment interface.  
In the Mopinion system you can enable or disable the feedback form when a user of your app executes the event.
The event could be a touch of a button, at the end of a transaction, proactive, etc.

<br>

## <a name="extra-data">extra data</a>

From version `0.3.1` it's also possible to send extra data from the app to your form. 
This can be done by adding a key and a value to the `data()` method.
The data should be added before the `event()` method is called if you want to include the data in the form that comes up for that event.

```swift
MopinionSDK.data(_ key: String, _ value: String)
```

Example:

```swift
import MopinionSDK
...
MopinionSDK.load("abcd1234")
...
MopinionSDK.data("first name", "Steve")
MopinionSDK.data("last name", "Jobs")
...
MopinionSDK.event(self, "_button")
```

Note: In the set of meta data, the keys are unique. If you re-use a key, the previous value for that key will be overwritten.

## clear extra data

From version `0.3.4` it's possible to remove all or a single key-value pair from the extra data previously supplied with the `data(key,value)` method.
To remove a single key-value pair use this method:

```swift
MopinionSDK.removeData(forKey: String)
```
Example:

```swift
MopinionSDK.removeData(forKey: "first name")
```

To remove all supplied extra data use this method without arguments:

```swift
MopinionSDK.removeData()
```
Example:

```swift
MopinionSDK.removeData()
```

<br>

## <a name="evaluate-conditions">Evaluate if a form will open</a>
The event() method of the SDK autonomously checks deployment conditions and opens a form, or not.

From SDK version `0.4.6` you can use the evaluate() and related methods to give your app more control on opening a form for proactive events or take actions when no form would have opened.

It can also be used on passive events, but such forms will always be allowed to open.

### Procedure overview

1. Call the `evaluate()` method and pass it the delegate object that implements the `MopinionOnEvaluateDelegate` protocol.
2. In your delegate's callback method `mopinionOnEvaluateHandler()`, check the response parameters and retrieve the `formKey` if there is any.
3. Optionally, pass the `formKey` to the method `openFormAlways()` to open your form directly, ignoring any conditions in the deployment.

### evaluate() method
Evaluates whether or not a form would have opened for the specified event. If without errors, the delegate object will receive the `mopinionOnEvaluateHandler()` call with the response.

```swift
public func evaluate( _ event: String, onEvaluateDelegate: MopinionOnEvaluateDelegate )

```
Parameters:

* `event`: The name of the event as definied in the deployment. For instance "_button".
* `onEvaluateDelegate `: The object implementing the `MopinionOnEvaluateDelegate` protocol to handle the `mopinionOnEvaluateHandler()` callback method.

### mopinionOnEvaluateHandler() method
Method where the app receives the response of the evaluate call. Defined by the `MopinionOnEvaluateDelegate` protocol. Note that in case of any system errors this may not be called at all.

```swift
func mopinionOnEvaluateHandler(hasResult: Bool, event: String, formKey: String?, response: [String : Any]?)
```
Parameters:

* `hasResult`: if true then the form identified by the formKey would have opened. If false then the form would not have opened and the formKey might be null in case no forms were found associated with the event.
* `event`: the original event name that was passed to the evaluate call to check in the deployment.
* `formKey`: identifying key of the first feedback form found associated with the event. Only one formKey will be selected even if multiple forms matched the event name in the deployment.
* `response`: optional dictionary object for extra response details on success/failure and forms. Reserved for future extensions.

### openFormAlways() method
Opens the form specified by the formkey, regardless of any proactive conditions set in the deployment.

```swift
public func openFormAlways(_ parentView: UIViewController,_ formKey: String) 
```
Parameters:

* `parentView`: Your UIViewController object that can act as a parent view controller for the SDK.
* `formKey`: key of a feedback form as provided by the mopinionOnEvaluateHandler() call.

### Example of using evaluate()
This snippet of pseudo code highlights the key points on how the aforementioned procedure fits together to implement the `MopinionOnEvaluateDelegate` protocol.

```swift
...
import MopinionSDK
...
// assuming that in your AppDelegate, you already did MopinionSDK.load(<MOPINION DEPLOYMENT KEY>)
...
class ViewController: UIViewController, MopinionOnEvaluateDelegate {
...
    func doSomething() {
        // check if a form would open                       
        MopinionSDK.evaluate("_myproactiveevent", onEvaluateDelegate: self)
        // the actual result will be in the mopinionOnEvaluateHandler call
	}
...
	// callback handler for protocol MopinionOnEvaluateDelegate
    func mopinionOnEvaluateHandler(hasResult: Bool, event: String, formKey: String?, response: [String : Any]?) {
        if(hasResult) {
            // at least one form was found and all optional parameters are non-null
            // because conditions can change every time, use the form key to open it directly
          	MopinionSDK.openFormAlways(self, formKey!)
        }else{
            if let _ = formKey {
				// Found form wouldn't open for event
				 // we'll open it anyway using the formKey             
				MopinionSDK.openFormAlways(self, formKey!)
            }else{
				// no form found for event
				...
            }
        }
    }
...
```

<br>

## <a name="callback-mode">Using callback mode</a>
By default the SDK manages the feedback form autonomously without further involving your app. 
SDK version `0.5.0` introduces callbacks to inform your code of certain actions (MopinionCallbackEvent). 

Provide a callback handler to receive a response, containing either data or possible error information. 


### Procedure overview

1. Call the `event()` method and pass it a callback method that implements the `MopinionCallbackEventDelegate.onMopinionEvent` protocol.
2. In your callback method `onMopinionEvent()`, check the kind of `mopinionEvent` and optionally call `didSucceed()` or `hasErrors()` on the `response` to check for errors.
3. Optionally, call `hasData()` on the `response` object to check if there is data.
4. Depending on the kind of `mopinionEvent`, check for the presence of data specified by a `ResponseDataKey` using the call `hasData(ResponseDataKey)` on the `response`.
5. To get the data, call `getString(ResponseDataKey)` respectively `getJSONObject(ResponseDataKey)` on the `response`, depending on the type of data to retrieve.

You can also provide an optional error-callback handler to `event()` to seperately receive responses with error information. In that case the primary handler only receives responses without errors.

<br>

### Callback variants of the `event()` method
Triggers an event you defined in your deployment to open a form and receive MopinionCallbackEvent callbacks. If you don't specify a failHandler, the callback handler will also receive error responses.


```swift
func event(parentView: event: onCallbackEvent:  onCallbackEventError:)
func event(parentView: event: onCallbackEventDelegate:)
func event(parentView: event: onCallbackEventDelegate:  onCallbackEventErrorDelegate:)
```

Parameters:

* `parentView`: The UIViewController that serves as parent view of the app.
* `event`: The name of the event as defined in the deployment for the form. For instance "_button".
* `onCallbackEvent`: a closure implementing the `onMopinionEvent()` callback.
* `onCallbackEventError`: a closure implementing the `onMopinionEventError()` callback for MopinionCallbackEvents that resulted in errors.
* `onCallbackEventDelegate`: The object implementing the `MopinionCallbackEventDelegate` protocol to handle the `onMopinionEvent()` callback.
* `onCallbackEventErrorDelegate`: The object implementing the `MopinionCallbackEventErrorDelegate` protocol to handle the `onMopinionEventError()` callback for MopinionCallbackEvents that resulted in errors.

<br>

### Callback methods `onMopinionEvent()` and `onMopinionEventError()`

These methods you implement in your code to receive MopinionCallbackEvents. They have the same parameters to pass you a response with optional additional information. 
What information is provided depends on the type of `MopinionCallbackEvent` and its origin.

```swift
func onMopinionEvent(mopinionEvent: MopinionCallbackEvent, response: MopinionResponse)
func onMopinionEventError(mopinionEvent: MopinionCallbackEvent, response: MopinionResponse)
```

Parameters:

* `mopinionEvent`: The kind of response event that you receive from the SDK. Currently one of the following:
	* `FORM_OPEN` : when the form is shown
	* `FORM_SENT` : when the user has submitted the form
	* `FORM_CLOSED` : when the form has closed
	* `NO_FORM_WILL_OPEN` : when no form will open

* `response`: The MopinionResponse object containing additional information on the MopinionEvent. The response is never `nil`, but use its `hasData()` methods to check if it contains any additional data, or `hasErrors()` for errors.

<br>

### MopinionResponse object
The data collection present in this object depends on the kind of MopinionCallbackEvent and its origin. The data is a key-value collection. Both data and errors can be missing. The response object contains methods to inspect and retrieve them. 


#### Getting data with `response.get()` and `response.hasData()`
Check with `hasData(key)` first, as the `get<>(key)` methods can return `null`. Pass a standard `ResponseDataKey` to these methods for the data you're interested in.

ResponseDataKey|Method to read it|Description
---|---|---
DATA_JSONOBJECT|.getJSONObject()|dictionary of the 'raw' JSONObject with all available data
FORM_KEY|.getString()|the internal unique identifier for the form
FORM_NAME|.getString()|the name of the form. Distinct from the title of the form.

<br>

#### MopinionCallbackEvents and provided data in `response`
This is the data that can be present for a certain MopinionCallbackEvent:

MopinionCallbackEvent|ResponseDataKeys|Remarks
---|---|---
FORM_OPEN|DATA_JSONOBJECT|
&nbsp;|FORM_KEY|
&nbsp;|FORM_NAME|
FORM_SENT|DATA_JSONOBJECT|
&nbsp;|FORM_KEY|
&nbsp;|FORM_NAME|
FORM_CLOSED|DATA_JSONOBJECT|Currently only automatically closed forms provide data 
&nbsp;|FORM_KEY|only when autoclosed
&nbsp;|FORM_NAME|only when autoclosed

The order in which MopinionCallbackEvents occur is:

	1. NO_FORM_WILL_OPEN
        
        - or - 
         
	1. FORM_OPEN
	2. FORM_SENT (only if the user submits a form)
	3. FORM_CLOSED

<br>

#### Reading `response` errors
Call `response.hasErrors()` , followed by `response.getError()` to get the error object.
The `getError()` method might return `nil`.

<br>

### Callback handler example to run code after send
Pseudo code to show the usage of the `event()` callback with closures and some involved objects to implement running code after send.
You must wait for the form to be closed after send before running any code affecting your own UI.

```swift
...
import MopinionSDK
...
// assuming that in your AppDelegate, you already did MopinionSDK.load(<MOPINION DEPLOYMENT KEY>)
...
class YourViewController: UIViewController, MopinionOnEvaluateDelegate {
...
    var wasFormSent: Bool = false	// track state outside closure
...
    func demonstrateMopinionCallback() {
        self.wasFormSent = false
    
        // open the form associated with the event "_myfeedbackbutton" from the deployment and receive callbacks in the closures        
        MopinionSDK.event(self, "_myfeedbackbutton", onCallbackEvent: {  (mopinionEvent, response) -> (Void) in
            print("callback in success closure")
            if(mopinionEvent == .FORM_SENT) {
                let formKey = response.getString(.FORM_KEY)!
                print("The form with formKey=\(formKey) has been sent, but is still displayed")
                self.wasFormSent = true
            } else if(mopinionEvent == .FORM_CLOSED) {
                if(self.wasFormSent) {
                    let formKey = response.getString(.FORM_KEY) ?? ""
                    print("The form \(formKey) has beent sent and closed, now you can run some code.")
                }
            } else if(mopinionEvent == .NO_FORM_WILL_OPEN) {
                print("No form will open for this event.")
            }
        }, onCallbackEventError: { (mopinionEvent, response) -> (Void) in
            let myError = response.getError();
            print("there was an error during callback: \(String(describing: myError))")
        } )
	}
...
}
...
```

<br>

## <a name="edit-triggers">Edit triggers</a>

In the Mopinion deployment editor you can define event names and triggers that will work with the SDK event names that you used in your app.
Login to your Mopinion account and go to Data collection, Deployments to use this functionality.

![Deployment Editor](images/deployment_edit_triggers.png)

The custom defined events can be used in combination with rules/conditions:

* trigger: `passive` or `proactive`. A passive form always shows when the event is triggered. A proactive form only shows once, you can set the refresh duration after which the form should show again. 
* submit: allow opening a proactive form until it has been submitted at least once. This affects the trigger rule, to allow opening a form more than once. Support for this appeared in SDK version 0.4.3.
* percentage (proactive trigger): % of users that should see the form  
* date: only show the form at at, after or before a specific date or date range  
* time: only show the form at at, after or before a specific time or time range  
* target: only show the form for a specific OS (iOS or Android) and optional list of versions.
